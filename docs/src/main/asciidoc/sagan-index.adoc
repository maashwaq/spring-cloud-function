:branch: 2.1.x

Spring Cloud Function is a project with the following high-level goals:

* Promote the implementation of business logic via functions.
* Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.
* Support a uniform programming model across serverless providers, as well as the ability to run standalone (locally or in a PaaS).
* Enable Spring Boot features (auto-configuration, dependency injection, metrics) on serverless providers.

It abstracts away all of the transport details and infrastructure, allowing the developer to keep all the familiar tools and processes, and focus firmly on business logic.

## Features

Spring Cloud Function features:

1. Wrappers for `@Beans` of type `Function`, `Consumer` and
`Supplier`, exposing them to the outside world as either HTTP
endpoints and/or message stream listeners/publishers with RabbitMQ, Kafka etc.

2. Compiling strings which are Java function bodies into bytecode, and
then turning them into `@Beans` that can be wrapped as above.

3. Deploying a JAR file containing such an application context with an
isolated classloader, so that you can pack them together in a single
JVM.

4. Adapters for https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/tree/{branch}/spring-cloud-function-adapters/spring-cloud-function-adapter-aws[AWS Lambda], https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/tree/{branch}/spring-cloud-function-adapters/spring-cloud-function-adapter-azure[Microsoft Azure], https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/tree/{branch}/spring-cloud-function-adapters/spring-cloud-function-adapter-openwhisk[Apache OpenWhisk] and possibly other "serverless" service providers.

Here's a complete, executable, testable Spring Boot application (implementing a simple string manipulation):

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

  @Bean
  public Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> uppercase() {
    return flux -> flux.map(value -> value.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```
